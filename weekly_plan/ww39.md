* Rules:
  1. Two robots race against each other - one on each track
  2. After the first race, the robot exchange lanes, so both robots try both lanes
  3. The sum of time for both lanes determines the "time"
  3. the fastest robot continue to the next level - it is an elimination course untill only two robots remains to do the finals
  3. We might need extra rules for, say, obstruction and not finishing
* Someone (aka. a student) needs to built the course
* Draft race course
